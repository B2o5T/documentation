title: "Concurrency"

The concurrency dzetermines the maximum number of parallel executions that are
allowed for this function. There is no limit on concurrency by default.

The Scheduler is in charge of enforcing the concurrency configured on your
background functions.

**FIFO**

When a background function is configured as FIFO (`concurrency: 1`), the
Scheduler will enforce the sequential processing of its executions.
