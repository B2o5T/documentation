The Scheduler handles the queue of your background functions. It ensures the
enqueuing and dequeuing happens in accordance to your configuration choices. It
feeds executions to Runner instances, and checks the results.

The Scheduler orchestrates the Runner to create an execution. This
page covers the lifecycle of an execution.

## State definitions

- **Created**: the execution is enqueued
- **Started**: the execution is running
- **Cancelled**: the execution has been Cancelled
- **Aborting**: the execution is being aborted
- **Aborted**: the execution has been aborted
- **Succeed**: the execution has run without any error
- **Failed**: the execution has failed with errors
