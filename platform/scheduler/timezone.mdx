Please note that the scheduler API operates solely in the `UTC`
timezone. However, some applications may not be configured to work
with `UTC`. To ensure compatibility, the scheduler API converts the
timezone of the `schedule_for` body parameter included in the enqueue
request to UTC datetime before storing the message.

For the CRON case, the timezone is UTC and cannot be altered due to
the absence of an enqueue request. However, we intend to introduce a
`timezone` parameter in the CRON definition in the future to enable
customization of the timezone for CRON evaluation.
