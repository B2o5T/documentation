supported. All native dependencies must be compatible with **x64**.

## Runner Types

Our Runners are **Docker** containers. We keep our docker daemon and client up
to date.

## Operating System

The operating system of our Runner containers is `Ubuntu 20.04`.

## IP addresses

Our Runners use the following IP adresses:

- `3.130.124.175`
- `3.140.205.180`
- `18.218.151.156`

## Operating region

We operate from AWS, in the `us-east-2` region.
