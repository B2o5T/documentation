The Runner differentiates between errors related to the execution of a background function.

## Timeout

<ResponseField name="name" type="TimeoutError">
  <ResponseField name="code" type="ER0001" />
  This error is thrown by the Runner when an execution exceeds the max duration configured
  on the corresponding background function.
</ResponseField>

## Out of Memory

<ResponseField name="name" type="OOMError">
  <ResponseField name="code" type="ER0002" />
  This error is thrown by the Runner when an execution is using more memory than
  the allowed maximum configured on the corresponding background function.
</ResponseField>

## Non Zero Exit Code

<ResponseField name="name" type="NonZeroExitCodeError">
  <ResponseField name="code" type="ER0003" />
  This error is thrown when the Runner exit code is different than `0`. It means
  your execution failed, and that there's an error in your code
</ResponseField>
