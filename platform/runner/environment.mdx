title: "Running Environment"
---

When an execution is dequeued by the Scheduler, it is passed to a new Runner.
Each execution gets its own environment, inside a **Docker** container.

## Binaries

The Runner environment ships with the following binaries:

- `google-chrome-stable`
- `doppler`
- `ffmpeg`
- `audiowaveform`
- `sox`

## Reserved environment variables

The following Environment variables are reserved and will be overrided if
configured on the environment's settings.

- `DEFER_TOKEN`
- `FORCE_COLOR`
- `NODE_DEBUG`
- `NODE_DEBUG_NATIVE`
- `NODE_DISABLE_COLORS`
- `NODE_EXTRA_CA_CERTS`
- `NODE_ICU_DATA`
- `NODE_NO_WARNINGS`
- `NODE_OPTIONS`
- `NODE_PATH`
- `NODE_PENDING_DEPRECATION`
- `NODE_PENDING_PIPE_INSTANCES`
- `NODE_PRESERVE_SYMLINKS`
- `NODE_REDIRECT_WARNINGS`
- `NODE_REPL_HISTORY`
- `NODE_REPL_EXTERNAL_MODULE`
- `NODE_SKIP_PLATFORM_CHECK`
- `NODE_TLS_REJECT_UNAUTHORIZED`
- `NODE_V8_COVERAGE`
- `NO_COLOR`
- `OPENSSL_CONF`
- `SSL_CERT_DIR`
- `SSL_CERT_FILE`
- `UV_THREADPOOL_SIZE`

## Doppler integration

The Runner supports **Doppler**. If you set up the `DOPPLER_TOKEN` environment
variable on your Defer environment, the Runner will recognize it and use
**Doppler** to populate its env.

## Puppeteer support

The Runner ships with **Google Chrome**, allowing you to use **Puppetter**
inside your background functions.

## Date and time

Inside a Runner container, the timezone is `UTC`.

<Note>
  Please take this in consideration when writing date/time-related logic in your
  background functions
