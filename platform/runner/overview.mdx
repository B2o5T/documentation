The Runner orchestrates the execution of your background functions when your
application calls them.

A Runner invocation is called an execution. This page covers the lifecycle of an
execution.

## State definitions

- **Created**: the execution is enqueued
- **Started**: the execution is running
- **Cancelled**: the execution has been Cancelled
- **Aborting**: the execution is being aborted
- **Aborted**: the execution has been aborted
- **Succeed**: the execution has run without any error
- **Failed**: the execution has failed with errors
