title: "Prebuild command"
---

The pre-build command is a custom command you can set up. It is executed after the installation of your dependencies,
and before the compilation of your background functions.

Examples: Prisma client generation or GraphQL Code Generator.

## Example

Here is a simple example of how to use a pre-build command to generate the prisma client.

Let's say you have the following script in your `package.json` file:

```
{
  "scripts": {
    "db:generate": "prisma generate"
  }
}
```

Then you can use the following pre-build command, depending on your package manager:

| Package Manager | Command                |
| --------------- | ---------------------- |
| **NPM**         | `npm run db:generate`  |
| **Yarn**        | `yarn db:generate`     |
| **PNPM**        | `pnpm run db:generate` |
