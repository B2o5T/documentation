title: "Cloning"
---

The Defer Github App that you authorize is used to clone your code.

## Code

The Builder fetches your project from GitHub, respecting the environment configured branch.
The Builder temporarily downloads your code from GitHub. Only
the code used in your background functions ends up being stored - for a
limited time on our servers.

## Submodules

We support git submodules, meaning you can have your background functions depending on modules from another repository.

<Info>
  The Defer Github App needs to be authorized on all the corresponding
  repositories
