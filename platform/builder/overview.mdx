In order to run your background function on its infrastructure, the Defer Platform needs to know about your node background functions. That is the role of the Builder.

Specifically, the Builder is responsible for the following:

- verification of your project compatibility (including defer background functions lookup)
- bundling of your background functions
- extraction of your background functions metadata (configuration of retries, concurrency, CRON)
- storing your background function bundles for later Runner use

A Builder invocation is called a build, and performs all those tasks on your project.

Each build is processed sequentially. This page covers the lifecycle of a build.

## State definitions

- **Created**: the build is enqueued and will soon start
- **Started**: the build has been picked up by the Builder worker
- **Cloning**: your project is being cloned
- **Installing**: your NPM dependencies are installing
- **Generating**: your pre-build command is executing
- **Compiling**: the Builder is compiling and bundling your background functions
- **Publishing**: you background functions bundles and build logs are being stored
- **Succeed**: the build is finished without any error
- **Failed**: the build has failed with errors
