## Supported Node Versions

The Builder currently only support LTS node versions (`16`, `18` or `20`).

## Supported package managers

We automatically detect your package manager. We currently support **NPM**,
**Yarn** & **PNPM**.

The package manager is detected via a lockfile lookup. If your lockfile is not
versioned, we encourage you to do so.

## Background functions

Once the Builder has downloaded your project, it starts looking for a `/defer`
folder containing your background functions files (one file per function since
`default` export is used). Here are the requirements for those files:

- `.js`, `.jsx`, `.ts`, `.tsx`, `.cjs`, `.cjsx`, `.cts`, `.ctsx`, `.mjs`,
  `.mjsx`, `.mts`, `.mtsx` extensions are supported
- `*.spec.*`, `*.test.*`, `*_spec.*`, `*_test.*` files are ignored
- `spec`, `test`, `specs`, `tests` nested folders are skipped
