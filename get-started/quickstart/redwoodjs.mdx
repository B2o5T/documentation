## Setup

### Use the Defer RedwoodJS CLI Plugin

For projects based on RedwoodJS `>= 6.3.0`, run the following command

```bash
  yarn rw setup package @defer/redwood
```

<Info>

This command runs the RedwoodJS CLI Defer plugin that will:
- install the `@defer/client` on your RedwoodJS `api`
- initialize a Defer client and create a demo `helloWorld()` background function.

</Info>

For projects based on RedwoodJS `< 6.3.0`, please refer to the [Custom stack getting started guide](/get-started/quickstart/custom-stack).



### Create a first background function

A background function is a function equivalent to a background job.

All background functions must live in the `defer/` folder shown above.

Choose how to create your first background function:

<AccordionGroup>

<Accordion title={"Start with the helloWorld() demo function"}>

The previous setup redwood setup command created a `helloWorld()` background function:

```ts api/src/jobs/defer/helloWorld.ts
// the defer() helper will be used to define a background function
import { defer } from 'src/jobs/clients/defer'
import { logger } from 'src/lib/logger'

const sleep = (seconds: number) =>
  new Promise<void>((resolve) => {
    setTimeout(() => {
      resolve()
    }, seconds)
  })

// a background function must be async
const helloWorld = async (name: string) => {
  await sleep(10)
  logger.info(`Hello ${name}!`)
}

// the function must be wrapped with defer() and exported as default
export default defer(helloWorld, {
  // retry: 5,
  // concurrency: 10,
  // maxDuration: 5 * 60 // in seconds
})
```

</Accordion>

<Accordion title={"I got a use case: a new feature or slow code to move in the background"}>

You already have a use case? Sounds great!

You can leverage the Defer RedwoodJS CLI Plugin commands to create a new background function:

```bash
yarn rw @defer function <nameOfTheFunction>
```

<Tabs>

  <Tab title='Move existing slow code or service to a background function'>

    Let's say you have an existing `syncContacts()` function in your API.

    First, let's run the following RedwoodJS CLI command to generate a new background function:

    ```bash
    yarn rw @defer function syncContacts
    ```

    And, let's move the existing function body in the `api/src/jobs/defer/syncContacts.ts` file:

    ```ts api/src/jobs/defer/syncContacts.ts
    // the `defer()` helper will be used to define a background function
    import { defer } from "src/jobs/clients/defer";
    // the `defer()` helper will be used to define a background function
    import syncContacts from "/src/services/syncContacts"

    // the imported function must be wrapped with `defer()` and re-exported as default
    // be certain your service is `async`
    export default defer(syncContacts)
    ```

  </Tab>

  <Tab title='Write a new feature, ex: syncContacts()'>

    You can create a new background function by using the RedwoodJS CLI Defer command:

    ```bash
    yarn rw @defer function syncContacts
    ```

    Then, update the newly created `api/src/jobs/defer/syncContacts.ts` file:

    ```ts api/src/jobs/defer/syncContacts.ts
    // the `defer()` helper will be used to define a background function
    import { defer } from "src/jobs/clients/defer";

    interface Contact { /* ... */ }

    // a background function must be `async`
    const syncContacts = async (contacts: Contact) => {
      // ...
    }

    // the function must be wrapped with `defer()` and exported as default
    export default defer(syncContacts)
    ```

  </Tab>

</Tabs>

</Accordion>

</AccordionGroup>

Our background function is ready to be used; let's see how to call it from your
application.

### Call your background function

Whenever you choose to use the `helloWorld()` function or create your own, the
following example showcasing how to call `helloWorld()` from a RedwoodJS
serverless function demonstrates how easily you can trigger a background
function execution.

First, generate a RedwoodJS serverless function:

```bash
  yarn rw generate function helloWorld
```

```ts api/src/functions/helloWorld/helloWorld.ts
import type { APIGatewayEvent, Context } from "aws-lambda";

import helloWorld from "src/jobs/defer/helloWorld";
import { logger } from "src/lib/logger";

export const handler = async (event: APIGatewayEvent, _context: Context) => {
  logger.info(`${event.httpMethod} ${event.path}: runHelloWorld function`);

  await helloWorld(event.queryStringParameters["name"] || "World");

  return {
    statusCode: 200,
    headers: {
      "Content-Type": "application/json",
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({
      ok: true,
    }),
  };
};
```

To test in local development, first start your RedwoodJS development server:

```bash
  yarn rw dev
```

Then, open your browser and visit the
`http://localhost:8910/.redwood/functions/helloWorld?name=Charly` function
endpoint.

Your development log should show the following:

```bash
api | 09:09:56 üå≤ incoming request GET xxx /helloWorld?name=Charly
api | 09:09:56 üå≤ GET /helloWorld: runHelloWorld function
api | 09:09:56 üå≤ request completed 1ms
api | 09:10:01 üå≤ Hello Charly!
```

and the response:

```json
{ "ok": true }
```

<Tip>

**How does Defer work locally?**

If you are wondering how calling a background function behaves locally, please
refer to this guide: [Development & Testing](/get-started/development-testing).

</Tip>

Once your RedwoodJS function is defined, please commit and push it to your
branch.

Now that your RedwoodJS contains a background function and a serverless function
that calls it, let's ensure that your Defer token and Build Settings are
correctly configured.

<Snippet file="setup-runtime.mdx" />

## Configure

### Create your Defer application

First, [sign in to the Defer Console](https://console.defer.run/), then, go to
the "Setup application page."

<AccordionGroup>

<Accordion title="1. Selecting a repository">

Install Defer on your GitHub account or organization on so Defer can list your
repositories:

<Frame caption="Ensure to install Defer on your GitHub account">
  <img
    src="/images/platform/get-a-token/install-defer-github.png"
    alt="Install Defer on your GitHub account"
  />
</Frame>

Then, select the GitHub repository of your application:

<Frame>
  <img
    src="/images/platform/get-a-token/choose-repo.png"
    alt="Select a GitHub repository"
  />
</Frame>

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="2. Environment variables (ex: Database access)">

The background functions that run in Defer might need to access some externally
configured services or databases. For this reason, we recommend using the **same
environment variables configuration** for your target API environment and Defer
application.

<Info>

**Got a `.env` file?**

Copy the file's content into your clipboard and paste it into the first field of
the "Add" line. ‚ú®

</Info>
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="3. Prisma generate command">

It's important to configure your Pre-Builds Settings to generate the Prisma
client before each build.

In Settings, go to `Advanced options` and then add the following
`Pre-build command` to generate the Prisma client:

```bash
yarn rw prisma generate
```

<Frame caption="Ensure to add the Prisma generate as pre-build command">
  <img
    src="/images/getting-started/quickstart-redwoodjs-build-settings.png"
    alt="Configure your Build Settings on the Defer Console"
  />
</Frame>

</Accordion>

</AccordionGroup>

Once your application is correctly configured, click the ‚ÄúCreate‚Äù button.

You should land on the application's page with a build running; you can go to
the Defer Console to check its status.

<Frame caption="Your first successful build on the Defer Console">
  <img
    src="/images/getting-started/build-success.png"
    alt="Your first successful build on the Defer Console"
  />
</Frame>

You can now get a Defer Token by navigating to the _Settings_ page:

<Frame caption="Copy your Defer token for the next step">
  <img
    src="/images/platform/get-a-token/copy-token.png"
    alt="Copy your Defer token"
  />
</Frame>

<Snippet file="api-deployment-configuration.mdx" />

## Deploy

Now, with your API deployment containing your Defer Token and your project's
builds ready on Defer, open your browser and test the RedwoodJS function
endpoint.

In the scenario of the `helloWorld()` background function, visit the
`/.redwood/functions/helloWorld` endpoint of your deployed application.

You should see that your API answered quickly, and by going to your
[Defer Console](https://console.defer.run/), you should see that your background
function has 1 execution running - or finished:

<Frame>
  <img
    src="/images/getting-started/functions-list.png"
    alt="Your first function on the Defer Console"
    width={800}
    height={900}
  />
</Frame>

By clicking on see executions, you will access the executions list:

<Frame>
  <img
    src="/images/getting-started/function-runs.png"
    alt="Your first successful function un on the Defer Console"
    width={800}
    height={900}
  />
</Frame>
