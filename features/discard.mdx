## Overview

Defer allows you to automatically cancel an execution if it hasn't been
processed within a set time frame. This is useful, for example, if you want to
avoid sending expired 2FA codes to your customers.

You can configure the discard option of a function with a specific datetime or a
duration.

<CodeGroup>

```js duration
const withDiscard = discardAfter(myFunc, "1h");
```

```ts datetime
const withDiscard = discardAfter(myFunc, new Date("1/1/24"));
```

</CodeGroup>

<br />

<Warning>

There could be a conflict between the discard and
[delay options](/features/delays). For instance, if you choose to discard an
execution after 5 minutes but have also delayed it for 1 hour, the execution
will be discarded. To avoid this conflict, you should set the discard option for
1 hour and 5 minutes.

</Warning>

## Example

<CodeGroup>

```ts index.ts
import { discardAfter } from "@defer/client";
import sendTwoFactorAuthenticationCode from "./defer/sendTwoFactorAuthenticationCode";

const discardableSendTwoFactorAuthCode = discardAfter(
  sendTwoFactorAuthenticationCode,
  "5m",
);
await discardableSendTwoFactorAuthCode(userId);
```

```ts defer/sendTwoFactorAuthenticationCode.ts
import { defer } from "@defer/client";

async function sendTwoFactorAuthenticationCode(userId: number) {
  // business logic here
}

export default defer(sendOnboardingEmail);
```

</CodeGroup>
