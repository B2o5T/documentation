title: "Concurrency"
description: "Control the number of parallel executions"
---

## Overview

Limiting the maximum number of parallel executions is a common
practice. For instance, when third-party services restrict the number
of concurrent calls to their service. This also helps distributing the
global concurrency limit into function limits, preventing one function
from consuming all the concurrency.

<Info>

By default, concurrency limit is not configured on background
function.

## Examples

```js FIFO
import { defer } from "@defer/client";

async function reIndexElasticRecords() {
      // business logic here
}

export default defer(reIndexElasticRecords, { concurrency: 1 })
```

```js Concurrent
import { defer } from "@defer/client";

async function importCurrencyRates() {
      // business logic here
}

export default defer(importCurrencyRates, { concurrency: 5 })
```
