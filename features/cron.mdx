## Overview

Defer allows you to schedule periodic execution. This is useful for example when
you have a weekly newsletter to send to your users every monday.

You can schedule a periodic execution using the `defer.cron` function rather
than `defer`.

```js
export default defer.cron(myFunc, "* * * * *");
```

<Warning>

With Defer CRON your schedule is defined in UTC.

</Warning>

## Example

```js
import { defer } from "@defer/client";

async function sendMondayNewletter() {
  // business logic here
}

export default defer.cron(sendMondayNewletter, "0 0 * * MON");
```

<Tip>

If you are not an expert of the CRON syntax, no worries! You can use the
[crontab.guru](https://crontab.guru/) website to build your CRON expression!
