## Overview

A CRON is a background function that is defined using `defer.cron()` instead of `defer()`, as follows:

```ts defer/weeklyBrief.ts
import { defer } from "@defer/client";

const weeklyBrief = async () => {
  // ...
};

export default defer.cron(weeklyBrief, "5 0 * * *");
```

<br />

<Info>CRONs schedule is based on UTC time.</Info>

## Full example: Weekly recommendations

Defer makes it easy to turn a function into a scheduled (CRON) background function.

In this example, a marketplace wants to send product recommendation to users on a weekly basis.

For this, we will create a scheduled function (`weeklyProductRecommendations()`) that performs the following steps:

1. Gather all the users that opt-in for the weekly product recommendation
2. For each users, in parallel:
   - invoke a background function (`computeProductRecommendation(user)`), that will compute the product recommendations and send an email

### CRON background function

A background function can be configured to run at a given frequency using `defer.cron(fn, frequencyStr)`:

```tsx defer/weeklyProductRecommendations.ts
import { defer } from "@defer/client";

const weeklyProductRecommendations = async () => {
  // ...
};

export default defer.cron(weeklyProductRecommendations, "0 8 * * *");
```

A scheduled background function is similar to a regular background function:

- a scheduled background function **should be async**
- a scheduled background function file **must be named following the function's name** and **export as default**

With some specificities:

- a scheduled background function **should not take arguments**
- a scheduled background function **should not be invoked** directly from your App (will result in errors)

Let's now see how to implement our product recommendation scheduled function.

### `weeklyProductRecommendations()` scheduled function

Our weekly product recommendation mechanism is implemented with 2 background functions:

```
- src/
  - defer/
    - weeklyProductRecommendations.ts ⬅
    - computeProductRecommendation.ts ⬅
  - ...
- prisma/
- package.json
- .env
- ...
```

<CodeGroup>

```tsx defer/weeklyProductRecommendations.ts
import { defer } from "@defer/client";
import computeProductRecommendation from "./computeProductRecommendation";

const weeklyProductRecommendations = async () => {
  const users = await prisma.user.find({
    where: {
      weeklyProductRecommendations: true,
    },
  });

  users.forEach((user) => computeProductRecommendation(user));
};

export default defer.cron(weeklyProductRecommendations, "0 8 * * *");
```

```tsx defer/computeProductRecommendation.ts
import { defer } from "@defer/client";
import { User } from "../prisma/generated/client";

const computeProductRecommendation = async (user: User) => {
  // 1. compute product recommendations ...
  // 2. send email
};

export default defer(computeProductRecommendation);
```

</CodeGroup>

Which translates to the following executions, on each Monday, at 8am:

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/features/cron/example.png" alt="CRON example" />
</Frame>

By leveraging the Defer background functions, our weekly product recommendation is:

- **Scalable**: by parallelizing the computation and sending of recommendations, the overall time to send the recommendations won't be exponential over time.
- **Reliable**: any error during a product recommendation computing or email sending will trigger a Defer Smart Retry.
- **Observable**: get an overview of the status of the reporting from the Defer dashboard.
- **Monitored**: get notified on Slack if the app couldn't deliver the product recommendation to a user.
