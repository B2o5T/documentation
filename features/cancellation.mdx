## Overview

Defer enables you to cancel a delayed execution or abort a running one.
Canceling a delayed execution comes in handy when you have a reminder system and
you need to remove one of them. Aborting a running execution is useful, for
instance, when you have an infinite loop in your function.

### Cancel

Since the execution has not started, we can preempt it, making the cancellation
process safe. Cancelling an execution is a synchronous operation, which means
you will receive the result of the operation immediately.

### Abort

Since the execution is running aborting it is inherently unsafe as it is
impossible to preempt what the execution is currently doing. That's why we
decided to not abort by default and give you the responsibility of making this
choice. Aborting an executions is an asynchronous operation. In most cases, it
takes less than a second, but in some contexts, it can take longer. Once a
request to abort an execution has been made, it is not possible to revoke the
request.
