description: "Schedule an execution for later."

## Overview

Defer allows you to schedule the time at which a execution will be
executed. This is useful for example if you want send to a user an
email 1 day after they sign up.

You can schedule a job in the future by using the `delay` function
with a specific datetime or duration.

<CodeGroup>

```js datetime
const delayFunc = delay(myFunc, new Date("1/1/24");
```

```js duration
const delayFunc = delay(myFunc, "1h");
```

</CodeGroup>

<Info>

The Defer scheduler only works with UTC datetime, so all datetime will
be converted to UTC. For example if you delay something to 1 hour
later, it will be align with your current timezone.

## Example

<CodeGroup>

```js index.js
import { delay } from "@defer/client";
import sendOnboardingEmail from "./defer/sendOnboardingEmail";

const delayedSendOnboardingEmail = delay(sendOnboardingEmail, "1h");
await delayedSendOnboardingEmail(userId);
```

```js defer/sendOnboardingEmail.js
import { defer } from "@defer/client";

async function sendOnboardingEmail(userId) {
	// business logic here
}

export default defer(sendOnboardingEmail)
```

</CodeGroup>


## Console

Even if the execution is scheduled for later you can still see it on
the Console under the "Execution" tab.
