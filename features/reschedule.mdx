## Overview

Defer allows you to reschedule an already enqueued execution, which is useful
when you have a scheduled notification and need to change the date.

## Examples

<CodeGroup>

```ts now
import { rescheduleExecution } from "@defer/client";

rescheduleExecution("0uk1Hbc9dQ9pxyTqJ93IUrfhdGq");
```

```ts datetime
import { rescheduleExecution } from "@defer/client";

rescheduleExecution("0uk1Hbc9dQ9pxyTqJ93IUrfhdGq", new Date("1/1/24"));
```

```ts duration
import { rescheduleExecution } from "@defer/client";

rescheduleExecution("0uk1Hbc9dQ9pxyTqJ93IUrfhdGq", "3h");
```
