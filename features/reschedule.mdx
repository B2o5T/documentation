## Overview

Defer allows you to reschedule an already enqueued execution, which is useful
when you have a scheduled notification and need to change the date. It is only
possible to reschedule execution in a queue, not while it is running or after it
has finished.

<Warning>

There could be a conflict between rescheduling and
[discard after option](/features/discard). For example, if you reschedule an
execution for a date after the discard after date, your execution will always be
discarded because the discard date comes before the rescheduled date.

</Warning>

If you call to reschedule without providing a specific date and time or
duration, the execution will be rescheduled for the current moment.

## Examples
