### Create your Defer application

First, [sign in to the Defer Console](https://console.defer.run/), then, go to the "Setup application page."

<AccordionGroup>

<Accordion title="1. Selecting a repository">

Install Defer on your GitHub account or organization on so Defer can list your repositories:

<Frame caption="Ensure to install Defer on your GitHub account">
  <img
    src="/images/platform/get-a-token/install-defer-github.png"
    alt="Install Defer on your GitHub account"
  />
</Frame>

Then, select the GitHub repository of your application:

<Frame>
  <img
    src="/images/platform/get-a-token/choose-repo.png"
    alt="Select a GitHub repository"
  />
</Frame>

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="2. Environment variables (ex: Database access)">

The background functions that run in Defer might need to access some externally configured services or databases. For this reason, we recommend using the **same environment variables configuration** for your target API environment and Defer application.

<Info>

**Got a `.env` file?**

Copy the file's content into your clipboard and paste it into the first field of the "Add" line. ✨

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Note: Monorepo, Prisma">

If your application resides in a mono repo or relies on Prisma, please refer to the [Builds](/platform/builds) page on advanced options.

<Frame>
  <img
    src="/images/platform/get-a-token/pre-build-command.png"
    alt="Pre-build command"
  />
</Frame>

</Accordion>

</AccordionGroup>

Once your application is correctly configured, click the “Create” button.

You should land on the application's page with a build running; you can go to the Defer Console to check its status.

<Frame caption="Your first successful build on the Defer Console">
  <img
    src="/images/getting-started/build-success.png"
    alt="Your first successful build on the Defer Console"
  />
</Frame>

You can now get a Defer Token by navigating to the _Settings_ page:

<Frame caption="Copy your Defer token for the next step">
  <img
    src="/images/platform/get-a-token/copy-token.png"
    alt="Copy your Defer token"
  />
</Frame>
