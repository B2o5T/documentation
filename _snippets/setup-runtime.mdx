### Setup your Node.js / Bun version

**Node.js** is the default runtime, and version `18.x` will be used if you don't
specify your own.

<Info>
  **Node.js** versions `18.x` and `20.x` are supported, and **Bun** versions
  `1.x` are supported.
</Info>

To change your runtime and its version, edit the `engines` field of your
`package.json`:

<CodeGroup>

```json Node.js
{
  ...
  "engines": {
    "node": "18.x"
  }
  ...
}
```

```json Bun
{
  ...
  "engines": {
    "node": "1.x"
  }
  ...
}
```

</CodeGroup>
