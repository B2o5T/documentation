## Continuous deployment

Once you have [created your account](https://console.defer.run) on the Defer
Console, continous deployment of your background jobs is enabled on the Defer
Platform. A deployment will be trigger each time you push a commit to your
configured branch. Your background functions are then bundled and pushed to the
Defer platform.

<Note>
  Only the code used in your background functions ends up being stored - for a
  limited time on our servers.
</Note>

## Git Submodules

We support git submodules, meaning you can have your background functions
depending on modules from another repository.

<Info>
  The Defer Github App needs to be authorized on all the corresponding
  repositories
