# Local development with Defer

An unified experience, from your local machine to production.

## Overview

Locally, background functions run in the background leveraging the `Promise` API, providing a behavior similar to production environments (with some [Limitations](#limitations)).

No additional package or local server is required, simply call your background functions and they will run locally, as expected:

<Tabs items={['defer/helloWorld.ts', 'pages/api/helloWorld.ts']}>

  <Tab>

    ```tsx filename="defer/helloWorld.ts" copy
    // the `defer()` helper will be used to define a background function
    import { defer } from "@defer/client"

    // a background function must be `async`
    async function helloWorld(name: string) {
        return new Promise(
        (resolve) => {
            setTimeout(() => {
            console.log(`Hello ${name}!`)
            resolve('done')
            }, 5000)
        }
        )
    }

    // the function must be wrapped with `defer()` and exported as default
    export default defer(helloWorld)
    ```

  </Tab>

  <Tab>

    ```tsx filename="pages/api/helloWorld.ts" {3, 14-15} copy
    import type { NextApiRequest, NextApiResponse } from "next";
    // we import our `helloWorld()` background function
    import helloWorld from "../../defer/helloWorld";

    type Data = {
        ok: boolean;
    };

    export default async function handler(
        req: NextApiRequest,
        res: NextApiResponse<Data>
    ) {

    // calling a background function will return immediately and execute it in the background
    await helloWorld("Charly");

    res.status(200).json({ ok: true });
    }
    ```

  </Tab>

</Tabs>

<Callout type={"info"}>
**What happen if I set a `DEFER_TOKEN` locally?**

We don't recommend doing it.

By setting a `DEFER_TOKEN` locally, all calls to your background functions will run them on the Defer Platform.

It will result in executing the version of your background function present in Git, not locally, which can be confusing.

## Advanced example: get an execution's result locally

The [`awaitResult()` and `getExecution()`](/features/getting-execution-result/) APIs work as expected locally, returning the status or result of an ongoing or finished local execution.

A complete working example is available on our GitHub:

<RepositoryCard
  name={"OpenAI + Next.js + Defer demo"}
  url={"https://github.com/defer-run/defer-openai-github-profile"}
/>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

## Limitations

<p>&nbsp;</p>

### API limitations

The following `@defer/client` APIs are not yet supported locally:

- `delay()`: will result in executing the function immediately
- `defer.cron()`: CRONs are not scheduled locally

<p>&nbsp;</p>

### Behavior limitations

Defer relies on the `Promise` API to execute background functions locally.

It means that all executions are bound to the parent process and will be cancelled if the parent process (ex: server) is force stopped.
