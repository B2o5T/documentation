# Background function Metadata

Assign metadata to executions for better filtering.

### Prerequisites

<Prerequisites
  items={[
    {
      title: "Defer basics",
      subtitle: "Get familiar with background functions",
      icon: "layers",
      link: "/features/background-function",
    },
  ]}

## Overview

As your usage of Defer grows, finding specific executions (for example, executions linked to a particular user email) gets more complicated:

<div className={"image"}>
  <div>
    <Image
      src="/features/metadata/executions-list.png"
      alt="Executions list can get hard to narrow to a smaller set"
      width={800}
      height={450}
    />
  </div>
</div>

Attaching metadata to your executions makes it easier to filter them on the Defer Console:

<div className={"image"}>
  <div>
    <Image
      src="/features/metadata/metadata-filter.png"
      alt="Metadata enables a quick filtering of the executions"
      width={400}
      height={450}
    />
  </div>
</div>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

## Usage

Attaching metadata to execution is achieved by using `addMetadata()` from `@defer/client` (from `1.4.0`):

```tsx
import type { NextApiRequest, NextApiResponse } from "next";
import { addMetadata } from "@defer/client";

import sendEmailsFn from "../../../defer/sendEmails";

export default async function handler(
  req: NextApiRequest,
  res: NextApiResponse<{ ok: boolean }>
) {
  const sendEmails = addMetadata(sendEmailsFn, { email: req.body.email });
  await sendEmails(req.body.email);

  res.status(200).json({ ok: true });
}
```

_A working example is available [in the `defer.demo` repository](https://github.com/defer-run/defer.demo/blob/master/nextjs/pages/api/emails/succeed.ts#L14)._

**Limitations**

There is no limit to the number of metadata assignable to an execution; however, for now, **values must be `string`**.

</Callout>

<br />

The _Metadata_ filter should appear on your Defer Console Executions List once new executions with metadata are received:

<div className={"image"}>
  <div>
    <Image
      src="/features/metadata/filters-with-metadata.png"
      alt="The Metadata filter should appear as soon as new executions with metadata are received."
      width={400}
      height={450}
    />
  </div>
</div>

<Callout type="info">

**Tips**

Multiple metadata filters can be combined in the same filtering.

Get the full powering of Execution List filters by combining _Metadata_ with _Status_ and/or _Executed At_ filters.

<div className={"image"}>
  <div>
    <Image
      src="/features/metadata/combine-filters.png"
      alt="Filters can and should be combined for better relevance."
      width={600}
      height={450}
    />
  </div>
</div>

</Callout>
