# Background function Concurrency

## Overview

By default, Defer Platform will execute background functions using your account limits (Free: 2, Pro: 10 to custom).
All executions are picked up on the right order, however, if you need to process things in a FIFO way, please use the `{ concurrency: 1 }` configuration.

## Configure concurrency

<p>&nbsp;</p>

```tsx filename="defer/importContacts.ts" {7} copy
import { defer } from "@defer.run/client";

const importContacts = () => {
  // ...
};
export default defer(importContacts, {
  concurrency: 2,
});
```

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

### Important notes on concurrency limits

Each account gets a maximum concurrency [(Hobby: 2, Pro: 10)](/platform/limits) that take precedence on the configured background functions concurrency.

For example, on a Pro Plan, if two background functions with `concurrency: 10` trigger 100 executions each, the Defer Platform will take 5 of each concurrently, matching the account's maximum concurrency (`10`).

## Combine concurrency and retries for API rate limiting

The combination of `retry` and `concurrency` is perfect for fixed API rate limiting.

For example, an `askOpenAI()` background function is limited to 10 calls per minute.

Knowing that `askOpenAI()` runs, on average, for 1min, the following configuration would be perfect to optimize the performance while
matching the OpenAI API rate limits:

```tsx filename="defer/importContacts.ts" {7} copy
import { defer } from "@defer.run/client";

const importContacts = () => {
  // ...
};
export default defer(importContacts, {
  concurrency: 10,
  retry: 5,
});
```

The `concurrency` ensures we don't cross the 10 calls per minute with our ~1min per call.
On the other hand, the `retry` option is here to recover some scenarios where multiple sequential calls would execute under 1min.

Here is an easy rule of thumb to find your perfect `concurrency` value for any API rate limiting scenario:

> concurrency = Math.floor(callsMaxPerMinute \* AvgDurationInMinutes)

| `concurrency` | `callsMaxPerMinute` | `AvgDurationInMinutes` |
| ------------- | ------------------- | ---------------------- |
| `10`          | `10`                | `1` (1 min)            |
| `5`           | `10`                | `0.5` (30 secs)        |
| `0`           | `10`                | `0.08` (5 secs)        |

The last line is a perfect example of the limitation of this approach.

Moreover, as many public 3rd party APIs rely on dynamic rate limiting using the [leaky bucket algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leaky_bucket) and other algorithms, we will soon roll out a `throttling` option to better configure rate limiting.
