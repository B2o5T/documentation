# Alerting

Stay on top of failures.

The Defer Console allows the setup of alerting at the environment level as Slack notifications.

## Setup alerting

To setup alerting on a given environment, go to its Settings page:

<div className={"image"}>
  <div>
    <Image
      src="/platform/alerting/alerting_1.png"
      alt=""
      width={800}
      height={900}
    />
  </div>
</div>

Then, click on the “Setup Slack notifications” button:

<div className={"image"}>
  <div>
    <Image
      src="/platform/alerting/alerting_2.png"
      alt=""
      width={800}
      height={900}
    />
  </div>
</div>

Once Defer is installed in your Slack workspace, you will be able to configure the alerting for Builds and Executions:

<div className={"image"}>
  <div>
    <Image
      src="/platform/alerting/alerting_3.png"
      alt=""
      width={800}
      height={900}
    />
  </div>
</div>

By default, only notifications on failures are enabled.

You will now be notified in Slack with quick access to the execution/build logs:

<div className={"image"}>
  <div>
    <Image
      src="/platform/alerting/alerting_4.png"
      alt=""
      width={800}
      height={900}
    />
  </div>
</div>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

## Update existing alerting rules

To update an existing notifications configuration, go to the Settings of the environment.

Then, enable or disable the given event types (success or failure) and click on “Update”.

<div className={"image"}>
  <div>
    <Image
      src="/platform/alerting/alerting_5.png"
      alt=""
      width={800}
      height={900}
    />
  </div>
</div>

To disable all notifications, please unselect all event types and click on Update.
