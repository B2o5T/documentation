# Getting started with Remix

Learn how to setup Defer with Remix and trigger your first background function.

<br />

### Prerequisites

<br />

<Prerequisites
  items={[
    {
      title: "Setup a Defer application",
      subtitle: "Ensure that your Defer application is properly configured.",
      icon: "defer",
      link: "/platform/setup-a-defer-application",
    },
  ]}
/>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

### Install the `@defer/client`

<Tabs items={['yarn', 'npm', 'pnpm']}>
<Tab>
  ```bash copy
    yarn add @defer/client
  ```
</Tab>
<Tab>

```bash copy
  npm i @defer/client
```

</Tab>
<Tab>

```bash copy
  pnpm i @defer/client
```

</Tab>
</Tabs>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

### Create a `defer/` folder

The Defer Platform expects to find all the background functions in the `defer/` folder.

In a Remix/t3 app, we recommend creating an `defer/` folder as follows:

```txt {3}
.
|-- app/
|   |-- defer/
|   |-- entry.client.tsx
|   |-- entry.server.tsx
|   |-- root.tsx
|   |-- routes/
|-- build/
|   |-- index.js
|   |-- index.js.map
|-- package-lock.json
|-- package.json
|-- public/
|-- remix.config.js
|-- remix.env.d.ts
`-- tsconfig.json
```

<br />

<Callout type="info">
**Notes:**
- The `defer/` folder can be located anywhere in your project
- The `defer/` folder can contain Remixed folders

</Callout>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

### Write a background function

A background function is a function equivalent to a background job.

All background functions must live in the `defer/` folder.

Choose how to write your first background function:

<Accordion title={"Start with the helloWorld() demo function"}>

Let's add the following `helloWorld.ts` function in your `defer/` folder, as follows:

<br />

```tsx filename="app/defer/helloWorld.ts" copy
// the `defer()` helper will be used to define a background function
import { defer } from "@defer/client";

// a background function must be `async`
async function helloWorld(name: string) {
  return new Promise((resolve) => {
    setTimeout(() => {
      console.log(`Hello ${name}!`);
      resolve("done");
    }, 5000);
  });
}

// the function must be wrapped with `defer()` and exported as default
export default defer(syncContacts);
```

</Accordion>

<Accordion title={"I got a use case: a new feature or slow code to move in the background"}>

You already have a use case? Sounds great!

Start by first creating a background function in the `defer/` folder and see how to implement it depending on your use case:

<Tabs items={['Move existing existing slow code to a background function', 'Write a new feature, ex: syncContacts()']}>

  <Tab>

    ```tsx filename="app/defer/syncContacts.ts" copy
    // the `defer()` helper will be used to define a background function
    import { defer } from "@defer/client"
    // the `defer()` helper will be used to define a background function
    import syncContacts from "../utils/syncContacts"

    // the imported function must be wrapped with `defer()` and re-exported as default
    export default defer(syncContacts)
    ```

  </Tab>

  <Tab>

    ```tsx filename="app/defer/syncContacts.ts" copy
    // the `defer()` helper will be used to define a background function
    import { defer } from "@defer/client"

    interface Contact { /* ... */ }

    // a background function must be `async`
    async function syncContacts(contacts: Contact) {
      // ...
    }

    // the function must be wrapped with `defer()` and exported as default
    export default defer(helloWorld)
    ```

  </Tab>

</Tabs>

</Accordion>

Our background function is ready to be used; let's see how to call it from your application.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

### Call your background function

Whenever you choose to use the `helloWorld()` function or create your own, the following example showcasing how to call `helloWorld()`, from a Remix `/hello-world` route, demonstrates how easily you can trigger a background function execution.

<br />

```tsx filename="remix/app/routes/helloWorld.ts" {2, 5} copy
import type { LoaderArgs } from "@remix-run/node";
import helloWorld from "~/defer/helloWorld";

export async function loader({ params }: LoaderArgs) {
  await helloWorld();
  return new Response("OK.", {
    status: 200,
  });
}
```

<Callout type={"info"}>
**How does Defer work?**

If you are wondering how calling a background function triggers an execution on Defer Platform, please refer to this guide: [How Defer works](/platform/how-defer-works).

</Callout>

<br />
<br />

Once your Remix Controller route is defined, please commit and push it to your branch.

Each Git commit push triggers a Build on the Defer Platform; you can go to the Defer Console to check its status.

<div className={"image"}>
  <div>
    <Image
      src="/getting-started/build-success.png"
      alt="Your first successful build on the Defer Console"
      width={400}
      height={450}
    />
  </div>
</div>

<Callout type={'info'}>
**A Defer application needs a successful build to accept executions
**

Double check that your Defer application has at least one successful build, otherwise you won't be able to execute your background functions.

</Callout>

Now that your Remix app contains a background function and an API route that calls it, let's ensure that your Defer token is properly configured.

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

### Copy your Defer Token

<DeferToken />

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

### Configure your API deployment

Your API deployment should expose your [Defer Token](/platform/how-defer-works) as an environment variable in order to get your background function deferred when called.

<Accordion title={'Set your Defer Token on Vercel'}>

1. Go to your [Vercel Dashboard](https://vercel.com/)
1. From your project, go to settings
1. Then, to "Environment Variables"
1. Finally, add a new environment variable with Key as `DEFER_TOKEN`:

<div className={"image"}>
  <div>
    <Image
      src="/getting-started/env-var-vercel.png"
      alt="Setup your Defer Token on Vercel"
      width={800}
      height={900}
    />
  </div>
</div>

</Accordion>

<Accordion title={'Set your Defer Token on Heroku'}>

1. Go to your [Heroku Dashboard](https://dashboard.heroku.com/apps)
1. Select your app, and go to settings
1. Scroll to "Config Vars" and click on "Reveal Config Vars"
1. Finally, add a new environment variable with `DEFER_TOKEN` as "key":

<div className={"image"}>
  <div>
    <Image
      src="/getting-started/env-var-heroku.png"
      alt="Setup your Defer Token on Vercel"
      width={800}
      height={900}
    />
  </div>
</div>

</Accordion>

<Accordion title={'Set your Defer Token on Render'}>

1. Go to your [Render Dashboard](https://dashboard.render.com/)
1. Select a service
1. Then, go to "Environment" and click on Add Environment Variable
1. Finally, add a new environment variable with `DEFER_TOKEN` as "key":

<div className={"image"}>
  <div>
    <Image
      src="/getting-started/env-var-render.png"
      alt="Setup your Defer Token on Vercel"
      width={800}
      height={900}
    />
  </div>
</div>

</Accordion>

<Accordion title={'Set your Defer Token on Fly.io'}>

Update your `fly.toml` configuration filename as follow:

<br />

```toml filename="fly.toml" {3} copy
[env]
  MY_ENV = "debug"
  DEFER_TOKEN = "<your defer token>"
```

</Accordion>

<Accordion title={'Set your Defer Token on other hosting providers'}>

Update your environment variables by adding the following:

- key: `"DEFER_TOKEN"`
- value: your Defer Token

</Accordion>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

### Deploy

Now, with your API deployment containing your Defer Token and your project's builds ready on the Defer Platform, open your browser and test the Remix Controller route.

In the scenario of the `helloWorld()` background function, visit the `/hello` route.

You should see that your API answered quickly, and by going to your [Defer Console](https://console.defer.run/), you should see that your background function has 1 execution running - or finished:

<div className={"image"}>
  <div>
    <Image
      src="/getting-started/functions-list.png"
      alt="Your first function on the Defer Console"
      width={800}
      height={900}
    />
  </div>
</div>

By clicking on see executions, you will access the executions list:

<div className={"image"}>
  <div>
    <Image
      src="/getting-started/function-runs.png"
      alt="Your first successful function un on the Defer Console"
      width={800}
      height={900}
    />
  </div>
</div>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
