The `awaitResult(deferFn)` transforms your function into an asynchronous call,
waiting for it to be executed on the Defer Platform. You can get its result like
your normally do with an `async` function.

Example:

<CodeGroup>

```js defer/sayHello.js
import { defer } from "@defer/client";

const sayHello = (name) =>
  new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(() => resolve(`Hello ${name}!`), 5000));

export default awaitResult(defer(sayHello));
```

```js src/printHello.js
import { defer } from "@defer/client";

export const printHello = async () => {
  const greetMessage = await sayHello("John Doe");
  console.log(greetMessage);
};
```

</CodeGroup>
