title: "cancelExecution()"
icon: function

The `cancelExecution` function cancels a pending or running execution
by its ID. By default, `cancelExecution` can only cancel pending
executions and throws an error if the execution is already
running. The `force` option allows for the cancellation of a running
execution.

<CodeGroup>
```js Cancel Execution
import { cancelExecution } from "@defer/client";
import { sayHello } from "./defer/sayHello";

const { id } = await sayHello("John Doe");
await cancelExecution(id)

```

```js Abort Execution
import { cancelExecution } from "@defer/client";
import { sayHello } from "./defer/sayHello";

const { id } = await sayHello("John Doe");
await cancelExecution(id, { force: true })
```

```js defer/sayHello.js
import { defer } from "@defer/client";

const sayHello = (name) => `hello ${name}!`;

export default defer(sayHello);
```

</CodeGroup>
