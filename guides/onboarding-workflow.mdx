title: "Onboarding workflow"

## Introduction

Application user onboardings tend to compose multiple actions (sending emails)
that might spread across multiple steps over time.

For example, when a user onboards, we might want to immediately:

- send a welcome email
- trigger a Hubspot contacts sync

then, make the user as onboarded and, a few days later: send a tutorial if the
user is not engaged.

While such workflow can be implemented in a distributed way, in a event-based
architecture, or with CRONs, **Defer offers a context-switch free and code-first
way to implement such workflows**.

Before jumping into the user onboarding workflow implementation, let's see how
Defer enables to run background functions in parallel while waiting for their
result, as needed in:

## Running background functions in parallel

Given the following project:

```
- src/
  - defer/
    - importContactsFromHubspot.ts â¬…
    - sendWelcomeEmail.ts â¬…
    - sendTutorialsEmailIfNoActions.ts â¬…
    - userOnboarding.ts â¬…
  - ...
- package.json
- .env
- ...
```

We want to call trigger and wait for the execution of
`importContactsFromHubspot()` and `sendWelcomeEmail()`, in parallel.

For this, will use the `awaitResult()` API, as follows:

```tsx src/demoParallelRuns.ts
import { defer } from "@defer.run/client";
import importContactsFromHubspot from "./defer/importContactsFromHubspot";
import sendWelcomeEmail from "./defer/sendWelcomeEmail";

async function myDemo() {
  const user = {
    /* ... */
  };

  // run the background functions immediately in parallel and wait for the results
  const results = await Promise.allSettled([
    awaitResult(importContactsFromHubspot)(user),
    awaitResult(sendWelcomeEmail)(user),
  ]);
}
```

If the background function execution succeded, `awaitResult()` will return the
value returned by the function.

If it failed, it will raise an error (the one raised by the background function
or a generic one.)

Now that we saw how to run multiple background functions in parallel to get
their results, let's see how to write our user onboarding workflow.

## Writing a workflow with Defer

Writing workflows with Defer is simple, **just call other background functions**
from your main background function.

Our `userOnboarding()` function would call other functions and execute as
follow:

<Frame>
  <img
    src="/images/features/workflows/workflow.png"
    alt="Hubspot contacts import workflow"
  />
</Frame>

As stated earlier, implementing such a workflow is achieved with simple
background functions calls:

```tsx src/userOnboarding.ts
import { delay, defer } from "@defer/client";
import sendWelcomeEmail from "./sendWelcomeEmail";
import importContactsFromHubspot from "./importContactsFromHubspot";
import sendTutorialsEmailIfNoActions from "./sendTutorialsEmailIfNoActions";

async function userOnboarding(user: User) {
  await Promise.allSettled([
    awaitResult(importContactsFromHubspot)(user),
    awaitResult(sendWelcomeEmail)(user),
  ]);

  // once the Hubspot data is synced and the welcome mail sent,
  //  let's flagged the user as onboarded
  await prisma.user.update({
    where: { id: user.id },
    data: { onboarded: true },
  });

  const sendTutorialsEmailIfNoActionsDelayed = delay(
    sendTutorialsEmailIfNoActions,
    "1 day"
  );
  await sendTutorialsEmailIfNoActionsDelayed(user);
}

export default defer(userOnboarding);
```

Congrats, you implemented your first workflow with Defer ðŸŽ‰

You can start this workflow from your application's API like any background
function: `userOnboarding(user)`.

Your workflow will benefit of all Defer's features:

- Analytics and logs on Defer dashboard
- Smart retries on child background failures
- Slack notification on workflow failures
- Cancel and re-run workflow from the Defer dashboard
