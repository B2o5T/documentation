title: "Enable FIFO executions processing"
---


Defer background functions [comes without a concurrency limit by default](/features/concurrency).
While Defer guarantees to pick up execution by their creation order, it cannot guarantee strict sequential processing when concurrency is enabled.

Processing executions in sequence is a requirement for multiple scenarios:
- Processing certain webhooks (e.g., Shopify webhooks)
- Processing tracking events (e.g., Hubspot events)
- Dealing with strict 3rd party rate limiting.


## How to enable the FIFO mode

To enable FIFO processing, set `concurrency` to `1` as follows:


```ts defer/importContacts.ts
import { defer } from "@defer.run/client";

const importContacts = () => {
  // ...
};
export default defer(importContacts, {
  concurrency: 1,
});
```
